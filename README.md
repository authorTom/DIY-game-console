**I'm designing and building my very own video game console!ðŸ˜Š** <br>
<br>
Ever since I can remember, I've been fascinated by technology - taking things apart, figuring out how they work, and putting them back together. There's something magical about the blend of creativity and logic that goes into technology. While I love losing myself in the world of video games, it's the technology behind those games that captures my imagination. <br>
<br>
So, I've decided to channel this passion into a project that's both exciting and a little daunting: I'm going to build a game console from scratch (well sort of). My approach is to use off-the-shelf hardware and open-source software to piece together a console that will hopefully meet my requirements described below. <br>
<br>
Why am I doing this, you might ask? Well, it's not just about the end product for me. This project is a journey of learning and discovery. I want to dive deep into the nuts and bolts of what makes a game console work, understand the challenges and joys of creating something on my own, and share those insights with others. <br>
<br>
Along the way, I'll be exploring everything from selecting the right components to integrating software that can bring my console to life. I'll document my successes, my inevitable stumbles, and everything in between. <br>
